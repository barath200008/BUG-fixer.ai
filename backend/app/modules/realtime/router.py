Mirrors: backend/src/common/websocket/realtime.gateway.ts (server side)

This is the piece that was missing entirely (see the "lands in Phase 5"
comment that used to be in main.py). A browser connects here with a JWT and
a projectId; this subscribes to that project's Redis channel and relays
whatever RealtimeGateway.publish() sends (from the Celery worker process)
straight through to the browser as-is.
