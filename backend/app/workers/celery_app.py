"""
Mirrors: backend/src/jobs/queue.ts + jobs/analysis.worker.ts (BullMQ -> Celery)

run_analysis_task now actually executes the pipeline (see
app/modules/analysis/pipeline_runner.py) instead of just logging a stub
warning. Celery tasks are sync by design, so this wraps the async pipeline
runner with asyncio.run() and opens its own DB session directly (Celery
workers don't have access to FastAPI's request-scoped `get_db` dependency).
